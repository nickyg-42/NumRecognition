# NumRecognition
Convolutional Neural Network proof of concept for practice. Currently relies completely on Keras, but I plan to code the network from scratch.

# Run:
* Download and run the executable (Windows only)

OR

* Clone the repository
* Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `python main.py` from the project root
