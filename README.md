# NumRecognition
Convolutional Neural Network proof of concept for practice. Trained on MNIST dataset and recognizes handdrawn digits 0-9. Currently relies completely on tensorflow libraries, but I plan to independantly create one from scratch in the future.

# Run:
* Download and run the executable (Windows only)

OR

* Clone the repository
* Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `python main.py` from the project root


# MacOS Warning: 

I ran into issues installing the `tensorflow` module. In the end, this is the only solution that worked for me (may be improper): `pip install tensorflow-macos`
