# NumRecognition
Convolutional Neural Network proof of concept for practice. Currently relies completely on Keras, but I plan to code the network from scratch.

# Run:
* Download and run the exe (Windows only)

OR

* Clone the repository, install the requirements, and run "python main.py" from the project root
